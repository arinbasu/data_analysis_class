# Data Analysis Class

This site contains Jupyter notebooks for the informal series of classes I have held for my students (PhD and Master degree students) on R, and data analysis. The notebooks and links for each class are contained here. To use these notebooks:

1. Get R (http://www.r-project.org)
2. Get Jupyter notebook (download from project jupyter), or if you are at the University of Canterbury and would like to attend this group, email me. We run this on a hosted Jupyter notebook or Rstudio instance. 
3. You can alternatively use Rstudio to run these codes (in that case use the Rmd files, not ipynb files)
4. Install the libraries in R:
  - tidyverse (`install.packages("tidyverse")`)
  - lavaan (`install.packages("lavaan")`)
  - semPaths (`install.packages("semPath")`)
  - knitr (`install.packages("knitr")`)
 
 We use markdown and bibtex for organising our bibliography. The bibtex file is hosted here and updated weekly. The readings are distributed as hyperlinks that you will need to download off the web. You can also access the readings through UC library if you like. We recommend that you read the full text of the papers before each discussion session. The goal of this project is to eventually put the materials in the form of a gitbook.
